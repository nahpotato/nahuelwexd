### Hi there! 👋️😃️

As this profile indicates, my name is Nahuel 😊️. Currently independent developer 💻️ and engineering student at the [National University of Córdoba](https://www.unc.edu.ar) 🏫️, in Argentina. I am passionate about free software and GNU/Linux systems 🐧️

I dream that someday a world will arrive where humanity supports each other to get ahead, solving our conflicts with dialogue and not war.

I'm currently developing an app for [GNOME](https://www.gnome.org) 👣️ called [Replay](https://github.com/nahuelwexd/Replay) 🔁️, intended to be your next way to watch YouTube videos 😉️. I also study in a [Digital House](https://www.digitalhouse.com) course to be a full stack web developer soon.

If you need my collaboration, do not hesitate to contact me by [Telegram](https://t.me/nahuelwexd) or by [email](mailto:nahual_gomca@outlook.com.ar).
